                <p class="welcome_text">Welcome to my Website!
                    I've created this space to showcase my journey and growing expertise as I transition my career into the tech field. Passing both CompTIA’s A+ certification and Network+ certification marks only the beginning of this exciting path and demonstrates my ability to solve complex technical problems with confidence.</p>
                <p>This website itself represents my hands-on approach to learning—I built it from scratch using HTML and CSS as a practical project to strengthen my coding skills. Working through each element and styling challenge has been both educational and rewarding.</p>
                <p>My learning journey continues with preparation for my CompTIA Security+ certification, which I'm scheduled to complete in late July 2025. Beyond certifications, I'm developing my programming capabilities with Python, HTML, and CSS. I'm enthusiastic about deepening my knowledge in these technologies while expanding my toolkit to include languages like JavaScript and C# in the near future.</p>
                <p>I believe in continuous growth and am passionate about applying these emerging skills to create innovative solutions. Feel free to explore my projects and follow my progress as I build my career in technology!</p>
